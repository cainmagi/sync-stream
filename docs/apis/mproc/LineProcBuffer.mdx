```python
pbuf = syncstream.mproc.LineProcBuffer(maxlen=20)
pbuf = syncstream.LineProcBuffer(...)  # Alias
```

The process-safe line-based buffer.

The rotating buffer with a maximal storage length. This buffer is the extended version of the basic `LineBuffer`. It is used for the case of multi-processing. Use the shared queue of this buffer to ensure the synchronization among processes. To learn how to use this buffer, see the [example](#example) on this page, or the [tutorial](/sync-stream/docs/sync-proc).

## Arguments

### Requires

|  Argument  |  Type  |  <center>Description</center>  |
| :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------- |
| `maxlen`   | `int`  | The maximal number of stored lines. This value has the same meaning of [<InlineIcon icon={octLinkExternal16}/>`deque.maxlen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque.maxlen) |

## Methods

### `clear` {#clear}

```python
pbuf.clear()
```

Clear the whole buffer.

This method would clear the storage and the last line stream of this buffer. However, it would not clear any mirrors or copies of this object. This method is thread-safe and should always success.

### `stop_all_mirrors` {#stop_all_mirrors}

```python
pbuf.stop_all_mirrors()
```

Send stop signals to all mirrors.

This operation is used for terminating the sub-processes safely. However, this method would not trigger `TERMINATE` or `KILL` signals. Instead, each mirror accepting the stop signal would trigger a `StopIteartion` exception. The checking for the stop signal happens each time when `write()` is used by the mirrors. By this way, most programs would be interrupted.

:::danger

Since this method does not send `TERMINATE` or `KILL` signals, it does not guarantee that the processes would be closed instantly. If users want to use this method, please ensure that the `StopIteration` exception is catched by the `LineProcMirror.send_error()`. The error would not be catched automatically. If users do not catch the error, the main process would stuck at `wait()`.

:::

### `reset_states` {#reset_states}

```python
pbuf.stop_all_mirrors()
```

Reset the states of the buffer.

During the interaction with the mirrors, the states of the buffer may change. If user want to reuse the buffer and start a new group of sub-processes, please use this method.

### `receive` {#receive}

```python
is_live = pbuf.receive()
```

Receive one item from the mirror.

This method would fetch one item from the process-safe queue, and write the results in the thread-safe buffer. The fetched results would be saved in the storage.

#### Returns

|  Argument  |  Type  |  <center>Description</center>  |
| :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------- |
| `is_live`   | `bool` | The finish flag. If this value is `True`, it means the buffer still needs to receive more messages from the mirrors. If `False`, it means that the close signals from all mirrors have been received. |

### `wait` {#wait}

```python
pbuf.wait()
```

The block waiting method. This method is simply implemented by the following codes:

```python
while pbuf.receive():
    pass
```

The method would make the current thread keeping blocked until the buffer receives all messages from the mirrors.

### `parse_lines` {#parse_lines}

```python
pbuf.parse_lines(lines)
```

Parse the lines.

This method would be triggered when the new lines are received (the exception or warning is not included). The default behavior is adding the item into the storage.

Users could inherit this method and override it with their customized parsing method, like regular expression searching. The default behavior is implemented by:

```python
pbuf.storage.extend(lines)
```

#### Requires

|  Argument  |  Type  |  <center>Description</center>  |
| :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------- |
| `lines`    | `[str]`  | A sequence of strs to be written in the storage. Users could catch any line item, and extract any specific information from it. |

### `read` {#read}

```python
lines = pbuf.read(size=None)
```

Fetch the stored record items from the buffer. Using the `read()` method is thread-safe and would not influence the cursor of `write()` method.

If the current written line is not blank, the `read()` method would regard it as the last record item.

#### Requires

|  Argument  |  Type  |  <center>Description</center>  |
| :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------- |
| `size`     | `int`  | If set None, would return the whole storage. If set a int value, would return the latest `size` items. |

#### Returns

|  Argument  |  Type  |  <center>Description</center>  |
| :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------- |
| `lines`    | `[str]`  | The returned messages. The messages have been already split by the line breaks. |

### `write` {#write}

:::caution

This method is prohibited for this class. Because the `write()` method should be only used by the mirror objects.

:::

## Properties

### `mirror` {#mirror}

```python
pbuf.mirror
```

Get the mirror of this buffer.

The buffer should not be used in sub-processes directly. Instead, the buffer/mirror work in master/slave mode. The property `pbuf.mirror` is an instance of [`LineProcMirror`](./LineProcMirror). It is used for providing the process-safe mirror of the buffer in the sub-process.

This property could not be modified after the initialization.

### `n_mirrors` {#n_mirrors}

```python
pbuf.n_mirrors
```

Current living mirrors. The buffer should still need to receive message until `n_mirrors` becomes 0. Each time `pbuf.mirror` is invoked, this value would be increased by 1.

## Example

<Tabs
  defaultValue="codes"
  values={[
    { label: 'Codes', value: 'codes', },
    { label: 'Results', value: 'results', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="codes">

```python
import contextlib
import multiprocessing
from syncstream.mproc import LineProcBuffer


def f(buffer):
    with contextlib.redirect_stdout(buffer):
        print('example')
    buffer.send_eof()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pbuf = LineProcBuffer(maxlen=10)
    with multiprocessing.Pool(4) as p:
        p.map_async(f, tuple(pbuf.mirror for _ in range(4)))
        pbuf.wait()
    print(pbuf.read())
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="results">

```shell
('example', 'example', 'example', 'example')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
