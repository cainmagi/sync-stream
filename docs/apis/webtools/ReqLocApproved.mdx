<APITopBar type="type" source="webtools.ReqLocApproved" />

```python
ReqLocApproved = Literal[
    "args",  "body",  "fields",  "fields-form",  "headers",  "cookies"
]
```

`ReqLocApproved` is a shortcut of a type literal.

`ReqLocApproved` is the literal notation of all possible request data locations.

Further more, here is a list of comments for these locations:

| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|    `args`     | Always be in the query string.                         |
|    `body`     | Usually be form.                                       |
|   `fields`    | Currently only used for files.                         |
| `fields-form` | A form that is put as a member of a field.             |
|   `headers`   | Forwarded from headers directly.                       |
|   `cookies`   | Special headers, need to be pretreated by cookie-jars. |
