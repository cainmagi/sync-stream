import octInfo16 from '@iconify-icons/octicon/info-16';

To install the package, just run

```shell
pip install syncstream
```

The basic tier of this package does not require any dependencies. It only supports the `syncstream` for the multi-thread and the multi-process cases.

## Extra features

The basic package would not contain the `file` and `host` modules. To install the package, please use the following options:

```shell
pip install syncstream[option1,option2...]
```

| Option  | Supports |
| :-----: | :------- |
| `file` | Install dependencies for the `file` module. The module provides `syncstream.LineFileBuffer`. |
| `host` | Install dependencies for the `host` module. The module provides `syncstream.LineHostBuffer`, and `syncstream.LineHostMirror`. |

## Run the tests

To verify whether the package is compatible with your device, please clone the project and run the tests:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cainmagi/sync-stream.git
cd sync-stream
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests
```

The package is only compatible with `python>=3.6`. If you find the package fails to pass the tests, please
