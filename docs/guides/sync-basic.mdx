import IconExternalLink from "@theme/Icon/ExternalLink";

The following example catches the python stdout and stderr:

```python showLineNumbers title="basic.py"
import syncstream

# Initialize the buffer.
# highlight-next-line
buffer = syncstream.LineBuffer(10)

# The buffer itself is a context supporting stdout/stderr redirecting.
with buffer:
    for i in range(20):
        print('Message', f'"{i:02d}".')
    print('Line break\nin middle.', end='')
    print('No line break.', end='')

# Check the results
# highlight-next-line
messages = buffer.read()
for mitem in messages:
    print(mitem)
```

In the definition of the buffer, we set the maximal number of catched lines as `10`:

```python
buffer = syncstream.LineBuffer(10)
```

The buffer instance could be passed to the redirect context. Inside the context, the `print` function would be redirected to the buffer. Each time a new line is detected, a new record item would be created by the buffer. The rules for detecting the new lines are the same as those of [`str.splitlines`<IconExternalLink/>][link-splitlines] in the stdlib.

After catching all lines, the results could be returned by

```python
messages = buffer.read()
```

Each item of `messages` is a `str` representing a line catched inside the context.
