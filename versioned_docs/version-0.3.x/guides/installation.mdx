To install the package, just run

```shell
pip install syncstream==0.3.3
```

The basic tier of this package does not require any dependencies. It only supports the `syncstream` for the multi-thread and the multi-process cases.

## Extra features

The basic package would not contain the `file` and `host` modules. To install the package, please use the following options:

```shell
pip install syncstream[option1,option2...]==0.3.3
```

| Option | <center>Supports</center>                                                                                                     |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file` | Install dependencies for the `file` module. The module provides `syncstream.LineFileBuffer`.                                  |
| `host` | Install dependencies for the `host` module. The module provides `syncstream.LineHostBuffer`, and `syncstream.LineHostMirror`. |

## Install the GitHub version

The GitHub version may be newer than the PyPI version during the development.
If users want to install the GitHub version, please ensure that
[Git<IconExternalLink/>][link-git] has been installed.

After that, run the following command to install the developer's version.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/cainmagi/sync-stream.git
```

## Run the tests

To verify whether the package is compatible with your device, please clone the project and run the tests:

```shell
git clone -b v0.3.3 https://github.com/cainmagi/sync-stream.git
cd sync-stream
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

The package is only compatible with `python>=3.6`. If you find the package fails to pass the tests, please

<p>
  {
    <DarkButton to={repoURL("issues/new/choose")} icon={octInfo16}>
      Fire an issue
    </DarkButton>
  }
